  <p>In an intuitive sense, freedom is collated with endless grass fields of creative plight.
After all what is to interrupt radiating creative disposition in such a setting? No man or external force to block you way. However in observation and consideration - expression is the swash buckling pirate against tirades of constraint. Is is the shadow that parallels the light, but never quite meeting. Creative or innovative processes are surely sovereign but outputs as would a black hole’s event horizon. Where the complexities only slip the cracks into the observable universe. The slightest protrusions, as the edge of the shadow, manifesting perceivable creative output.
A child prefers play to the laborial monitoring of pivots - so he sets up a simple machine that at a tug of a string an engine cavern  opens akin to the pivot’s oscillations. The child is limited in energy, time and preference - all of his aforementioned actions resulting from the said constraints. Its Yin to Yang, Sun to Rain. We concoct to battle entropy (disorder) so we can be allowed play. Life is a gam after all.</p>
