Call me Quesada. I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.icf.com/" target="_blank">ICF</a> specializing in Web Applications. However, I preference taxonomizing this laborious species of labor under distributed applications development. This blog is new (as of 23102017) and given I entertain varying interests; new content will arrive with increasing momentum throughout time dependent on the burdens of such time. 

Terra Incognita is Latin for 'unknown territory' and that is really where this is going. From the great history of Quixote and Panza this is inspired. Like Cervantes commenting on the works of Cide Hamete; I will comment on other works and pass judgement to aid in your own piques. We all arrive one place or another for our own purposes; purposing the following quote appropriate to the purpose of these written works you find purpose in:

> "If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away."
- Henry David Thoreau
