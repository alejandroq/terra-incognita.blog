## Goal

Demonstrate a high value per unit effort inherent to serverless applications as it pertains to:

- pay-as-you-go
- recouping overhead costs
- recouping maintenance costs

## What is FaaS?

From Wikipedia:

> Function as a service (FaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app [1]. Building an application following this model is one way of achieving a "serverless" architecture, and is typically used when building microservices applications.

> FaaS is an extremely recent development in cloud computing, first made available to the world by hook.io in October 2014,[2] followed by AWS Lambda,[3] Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM/Apache's OpenWhisk (open source) in 2016 and Oracle Cloud Fn (open source) in 2017 which are available for public use. FaaS capabilities also exist in private platforms, as demonstrated by Uber's Schemaless triggers[4].

## Why use FaaS?

While FaaS maintains a slim class of its own complexities (see AWS Lambda limitations below), it allows for a focus on code and less on maintaining infrastructure (including OS patches, etc). Strategies for cycling servers and load balancing take a step back to API versioning strategies (which is no simpler in typical infrastructure) and the limitations below.

FaaS deltas Platform as a Service (PaaS) in that the latter requires always requires a running thread - even if it handles load balancing. FaaS, starting with AWS Lambda, are "on-demand" and metered per subsecond use. PaaS is closer to a more typical server setup, however it is hosted by a compensated entity.

Utilizing FaaS recoups costs via pay-as-you-go, reduced server maintenance, 'infinite' horizontal scaling and configurable vertical scaling.

Use cases: [https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

We will be focusing on AWS Lambda from here on out.

Lambda supports an array of languages including:

- Go
- C#
- NodeJS
- Python
- Java 8

## AWS Lambda Limitations

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html)

Summary:

- AWS Lambda Account Limits per Region
  - Concurrent Executions: 1000 (default limit - can be increased)
- AWS Lambda Resource Limits per Invocation
  - Maximum duration execution time: 300s or 5min
  - Memory allocation range: min 128MB / max 3008MB with 64MB increments
  - `/tmp` space for writing is limited to 512MB
  - Deployment package size (compressed .zip/.jar file): 50MB

Though called Serverless, Lambdas DO live on a server in Amazon's Cloud. When a function is first called it is susceptible to a **cold start**. To picture, when a user first calls your Java Lambda, your Java Lambda must warm up the JVM and then compute results for the requestee. Of course this results in atypical long request times. This occurs somewhat unpredictably (typically happening in the first few calls after a long gap in calls where it silently warms down). User behavior can be nonlinear, therefore concurrent executions of a Lambda in a pre-loaded state can cause multiple cold starts affecting numerous users response delivery times. There are strategies for this such as: keeping your function warm (with analytics you can determine best times to do so, etc: [https://hackernoon.com/im-afraid-you-re-thinking-about-aws-lambda-cold-starts-all-wrong-7d907f278a4f](https://hackernoon.com/im-afraid-you-re-thinking-about-aws-lambda-cold-starts-all-wrong-7d907f278a4f)). Considering Lambda's free tier allows for a one million free invocations, anything smaller than a midtier application should not be adversely affected by redundant calls service invocations.

FaaS in general is probably a poor solution if your project maintains heavy partition intolerance.

## Getting Started

You must create an S3 Bucket to stash either your CloudFormation templates or code (.zip|.jar) for your Lambdas.

```sh
aws s3 mb s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
```

## Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation

<!-- todo visualize -->

CloudFormation (CF) is an AWS service that consumes a declarative template (.json|.yaml) and orchestrates the production of the infrastructure declared. This service is used under the hood for Elastic Beanstalk and other peer services.

An example CloudFormation project is found in `01-cloudformation`.

Barring details into the intricacies, the YAML documents live in the `src` directory and a shell script for CloudFormation template validation lives in the `tests` directory. The `deploy` shell script packages your validated `src` templates and syncs them into your S3 Bucket. These specific scripts require you pass in your local AWS Profile as an argument.

```sh
# bash deploy <AWS_PROFILE>
bash deploy testaccount
```

Snippets and example CloudFormation Templates from Amazon:

- [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_TemplateQuickRef.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_TemplateQuickRef.html)
- [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/sample-templates-services-us-west-2.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/sample-templates-services-us-west-2.html)

## What is SAM?

The Serverless Application Model (SAM) is a pre-processor to CF notarized by the following header within the YAML or JSON files:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
```

Templates with the `Transform` header are treated slightly different (as they are preprocessed) within the CloudFormation service allowing us to do much more in less. The SAMCLI takes advantage of this and abstracts additional complexity by provisioning boilerplate function applications, validation and deployment.

The AWS CLI's CloudFormation command requires a few steps to update a Lambda:

- Upload code zip an S3 location contracted within the CF YAML (must meet URL structure advertised); if you use `aws cloudformation package` before hand, then your `CodeUri` pointed (.zip|.jar) will be uploaded into the S3 Bucket you provide as an argument.
- Upload and run CloudFormation by S3 URL or CLI appropriately.

<!-- TODO how does SAM handle versioning? -->

Vanilla CloudFormation requires explicit versioning of a Lambda function (`latest`, etc). Some services such as CloudWatch assume `latest` version.

Why use SAM when we have CF? For serverless applications, to accommodate a single Lambda function request you would need at a minimum the following resources separately declared and properly configured:

- AWS::IAM::Role
- AWS::Lambda::Function
- AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi
- AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment
- AWS::OtherThings::ForSure

In-contrast to vanilla CloudFormation, SAM abstracts the development of the aforementioned resources whilst adding in a few additions such as X-Ray, CloudWatch and CodeDeploy.

```yaml
HelloWorldFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function # More info about Function Resource: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#awsserverlessfunction
    Properties:
      CodeUri: hello-world/
      Handler: hello-world
      Runtime: go1.x
      Tracing: Active # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html
      AutoPublishAlias: live
      DeploymentPreference:
        Type: Canary10Percent10Minutes
      MemorySize: 128
      Events:
        CatchAll:
          Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#api
          Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: GET
      Environment: # More info about Env Vars: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#environment-object
        Variables:
          PARAM1: VALUE
```

Conclusively, SAM will produce an API Gateway with the `/hello` route, a Lambda for said route and numerous other configurable options.

## SAM Commands

```text
  init      Initialize a serverless application with a...
  package   Package an AWS SAM application. This is an alias for 'aws
            cloudformation package'.
  local     Run your Serverless application locally for...
  validate  Validate an AWS SAM template.
  deploy    Deploy an AWS SAM application. This is an alias for 'aws
            cloudformation deploy'.
```

### `init`

> Initialize a serverless application with a SAM template, folder structure for your Lambda functions, connected to an event source such as APIs, S3 Buckets or DynamoDB Tables. This application includes everything you need to get started with serverless and eventually grow into a production scale application.
> This command can initialize a boilerplate serverless app. If you want to create your own template as well as use a custom location please take a look at our official documentation.

tl;dr: creates a boiler plate function with a template.yaml, code and an initial test framework.

### `validate`

```sh
$ sam validate
template.yaml is a valid SAM Template
```

### `package`

```yaml
HelloWorldFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      CodeUri: hello-world/
      Handler: hello-world
```

Point CodeUri to your codes .zip in your template.yaml. Provide an S3 location in the CLI and get a CF document with the .zip packaged, sent to S3 and then CodeUri replaced with its actual S3 URL.

### `local`

Host your API in a Docker container locally, invoke an event by passing in JSON or generate an Event JSON from the following events:

```txt
Commands:
  api       Generates a sample Amazon API Gateway event
  dynamodb  Generates a sample Amazon DynamoDB event
  kinesis   Generates a sample Amazon Kinesis event
  s3        Generates a sample Amazon S3 event
  schedule  Generates a sample scheduled event
  sns       Generates a sample Amazon SNS event
```

An example of event generation and then a test invokation:

```txt
(samcli27) ➜  03-sam-local git:(master) ✗ samdev local generate-event api > request.json
(samcli27) ➜  03-sam-local git:(master) ✗ samdev local invoke -t helloworld-go/template.yaml -e request.json
2018-05-17 08:34:40 Invoking hello-world (go1.x)

```

Take note of the 'Max Memory Used', 'Memory Size' and 'Duration' as they all relate to billing in the Cloud.

You can host the API in a local Docker container pictured below:

![Screenshot](../../../images/introduction-serverless-applications/03-sam-local.png)

_Note: be sure to include path such as `/hello` at end of `127.0.0.1:PORT` or else you will get an anonymous `403`_

If you require advanced local networking between services, you can declare your API into specific Docker networks.

If you require environmental variables, the option also exists via: `sam local start-api -t TEMPLATE -n env.json`.

If you require integration testing, this could be a good place to do so locally. You can input an event.json and could test a possibly deterministic output. On the topic of testing, unit tests should still occur locally and functional testing against a browser running a client to your API. That is all I will comment on as per the rabbit hole of testing here.

### `deploy`

Deploy your packaged function. Have a Hello World in less than five minutes.

```sh
$ samdev deploy --template-file helloworld-go/build.output.yaml --stack-name helloworld --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --profile testaccount --region us-east-1
Waiting for changeset to be created..
Waiting for stack create/update to complete
Successfully created/updated stack - helloworld
```

## Putting it all Together from SAM Itself

The following instructions come from a SAM `init`ted function boilerplate's README.md:

````txt
    aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
    ```

    Next, run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

    ```bash
    sam package \
        --template-file template.yaml \
        --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
        --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
    ```

    Next, the following command will create a CloudFormation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

    ```bash
    sam deploy \
        --template-file packaged.yaml \
        --stack-name helloworld-go \
        --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
    ```

    > **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for more details in how to get started.**

    After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
        --stack-name helloworld-go \
        --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
    ```
````

## APP: Hello World(s) APIs

Head fake! We did this in `06-sam-deploy`.

## APP: Todo List PWA / API

I started this at 10:08AM on 05/17/18.

Checkout the directory `07-todo-list` for a complete:

Hot stopped for this presentation at 11:50AM on 5/17/18 and logged the aforementioned progress.

Known complications:

- SAM CLI is rather new, so there are a few issues. For this presentation I used a version built from source (see `HISTORY` for commands)
- Debugging and logging serverless is still peculiar (but getting better). Handled via CloudWatch and X-Ray in production. Locally a command can be passed to `sam local [OPTION]` to run your function in a Docker container that is open to popular debugging tools for the respective techonology in play.
- Testing DynamoDB locally is challenging and not very representative of the actual production DynamoDB

## Pricing

In-lieu of writing extensive on the topic (as there are many articles that go into detail - I am attaching the below screens)

Lambda (note: API Gateway not included in this)
![Screenshot](../../../images/introduction-serverless-applications/xx-price-2.png)

![Screenshot](../../../images/introduction-serverless-applications/xx-price-1.png)

## Security

- API Gateway has optional settings for token requirements, etc to faciliate requests
- SAM abstracts this, but typically API Gateway must be given permission to run a specific Lambda Resource
- The Lambda must be given explicit permissions to interact with other services such as RDS with Resource-based Authorizations
- The Lambda invokation authorization can be enforced via IAM Policies, Resource-based Authorizations and Role-based Authorizations

## The Definitive Maxim of 05/17/18

Everything is an event stream.

I recommend you look up Pub/Sub models. Nothing new, but really incredible and finding itself everywhere from infrastructure to front-end applications. [https://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0321200683/ref=nosim/enterpriseint-20](https://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0321200683/ref=nosim/enterpriseint-20)

## Other Notable Serverless Options

- CodePipeline and CodeBuild
  - Serverless CI/CD. No hosted Jenkins necessary.
- CloudFront and S3 Website
  - $$$ = ( ( 2.3 cents / month ) * GB ) + Traffic *first GB of transfer/month is free tier\*
- CloudFront and Lambda@Edge
  - Compute at edge and replicate a Web Application server at AWS Edge Locations.
- DynamoDB
  - NoSQL Document DB
  - An older product and therefore has the strangest pricing
  - Trusted with incredible workloads in the wild
- IoT (just really cool)
- Greengrass (still really cool)
- A lot more and probably more as of this reading
